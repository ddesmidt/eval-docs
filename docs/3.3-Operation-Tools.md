</p>  

NSX offers a graphical representation of its network topology.
- Log on NSX-T Manager UI.  
In a browser: https://192.168.50.5/.  
  <p align="center">

- Display the NSX Network Topology  
Under "Networking - xxx".
<p align="center">

### 3.3.1. Traceflow

<details>
<summary>"Click to expand"</summary>

Traceflow allows you to inject a packet into the network and monitor its flow across the network.  
Traceflow allows you to identify the path a packet takes to reach its destination or, conversely, where a packet is dropped along the way.  
Each entity reports the packet handling on input and output, so you can determine whether issues occur when receiving a packet or when forwarding the packet.

- Check the Traceflow from VM3 HTTP to VM7  
Under "Networking - xxx".

*Note: Even if that traffic is routed, it actually does not leave the ESXi1 since the NSX Logical Routers are distributed.*


- Check the Traceflow from VM1 HTTP to VM3  
Under "Networking - xxx".
<p align="center">
